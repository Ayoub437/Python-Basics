# So in the console will be as result 55.

# If I defined a variable with integer, I can not add a string within the parentheses.

# A good thing to know is if I have a number which is too big, an "inf" will appear in my console.
# That "inf" stands for infinity = unendlich


# If in the console is "nan" = not a number. It means it is not calculable = berechenbar
