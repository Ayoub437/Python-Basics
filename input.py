# In this file I learn the input-function

# Through these parentheses the input-funtion will be executed.
# The input-function stops the other print command.
# As soon as the input command is executed, the program stops and wait for an input from the user in the console.
# If I assign the input-function to a variable, then I use that variable in the print-command in the next line.
# If I do that, The value of that variable, in this case input-function, is to be printed in the console.
# Die Eingabe t√§tige ich in der Konsole.
print("Eating")
time = input()
print("I ate my lunch " + time)

print("To do list")
today = input()
print("The things I wanted to do is done " + today)
input()

print("Hello")
city = input()
print("I just wanna tell you " + city)
input()

# Another kind of input-function
# The string inside the input-function will appear in the console.
# I can write something next to the string in the console and the writing will be in green.
# After I did it, it will be emitted=(ausgegeben) in the next line in the console.
