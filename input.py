# In this file I learn the input-function

# Through these parentheses the input-funtion will be executed.
# The input-function stops the other print command.
# As soon as the input command is executed, the program stops and wait for an input from the user in the console.
# If I assign the input-function to a variable, then I use that variable in the print-command.
# Die Eingabe t√§tige ich in der Konsole.
